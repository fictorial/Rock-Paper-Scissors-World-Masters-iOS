*RPS WORLD MASTERS* is an addictive online-only version of the classic
Rock Paper Scissors game for the iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad.

## Rock Paper Scissors?

Never played Rock Paper Scissors before? No problem! It's easy! Throw
rock, paper, or scissors at the same time as your opponent. Rock crushes
scissors; paper covers rock; scissors cuts paper. Easy, right? Sure!
But, can you devise a STRATEGY to beat another human player over and
over again? Strategy? Really? Yes, really! Throw rock every time and
your opponent will obviously notice your oh-so-sly pattern and destroy
you. You'll just pick one at random? There is no such thing as "random"!
Your opponent will figure out what your SUBCONSCIOUS is up to and will
soundly defeat you.

## How it Works

You will be automatically paired with random opponents from anywhere
around the world. Or, challenge your friends to settle silly disputes,
assign lowly chores, or to finally prove that to them that you are a
true mind reader! Clever must you be to win! Play well and you will
climb the online leader board. Lose often and your friends will make fun
of your goofy hipster shoes.

Each match is in the "best of 3 of 3" format. Win 2 out of 3 throws
(e.g. rock wins against scissors) to win a set (like in tennis). Win 2
out of 3 sets to win the match. Matches take less than a minute to play
and are completely addictive! You have been warned!

## Please Note

RPS WORLD MASTERS requires an *active Internet connection* to play. Online
functionality works over 3G and Wi-Fi using Apple's Game Center.

For the RPS gurus, we hope RPS WORLD MASTERS is the perfect TRAINING
system for the many LIVE tournaments held each year. Please let us know
